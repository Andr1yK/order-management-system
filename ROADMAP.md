# Microservices Architecture Migration Checklist

## Step 1: Preparation for Migration

- [x] Conduct an audit of the current monolithic application
    - [x] Define clear domain boundaries (Users and Orders)
    - [x] Analyze dependencies between domains
    - [x] Document API contracts between domains

- [x] Create a deployment strategy
    - [x] Choose the "strangler pattern" approach for gradual migration
    - [x] Develop a plan for handling existing data
    - [x] Define a testing strategy during migration

## Step 2: Database Isolation

- [x] Create separate schemas for each domain
    - [x] Create `user_service_db` schema for the user table
    - [x] Create `order_service_db` schema for the orders table

- [ ] Set up interaction between schemas
    - [x] Establish foreign keys between schemas
    - [ ] Set access rights to schemas

- [x] Confirm both schemas work correctly
    - [x] Test CRUD operations on tables in different schemas
    - [x] Check data integrity between schemas

## Step 3: User Service Creation

- [x] Create a project for the user microservice
    - [x] Set up the project structure
    - [x] Set up database access (`user_service_db` schema)
    - [x] Implement necessary models

- [x] Implement REST API
    - [x] Implement authentication routes (login/register)
    - [x] Implement CRUD operations for users
    - [x] Set up middleware for authorization and validation

- [x] Set up user request routing
    - [x] Set up API Gateway or proxy in the monolithic app
    - [x] Ensure requests to `/api/users` and `/api/auth` go to the new service

## Step 4: Monolithic Application Adaptation

- [x] Update the monolithic application
    - [x] Remove user logic from the monolithic app
    - [x] Set up HTTP client for communication with the user service
    - [x] Update order controllers to interact with the user service

- [x] Set up request proxying
    - [x] Implement proxy routes for `/api/users` and `/api/auth`
    - [x] Set up error handling when the user service is unavailable

- [x] Integration testing
    - [x] Verify that the monolithic application interacts correctly with the user service
    - [x] Check that authorization works via JWT tokens

## Step 5: Transition to the Order Service

- [x] Create a project for the order microservice
    - [x] Set up the project structure
    - [x] Set up database access (`order_service_db` schema)
    - [x] Implement necessary models (orders and order items)

- [x] Implement REST API
    - [x] Implement CRUD operations for orders
    - [x] Set up middleware for authorization

- [x] Set up interaction between services
    - [x] Implement HTTP client for communication with the user service
    - [x] Implement user validation mechanism for order operations

## Step 6: API Gateway Setup

- [ ] Choose and set up an API Gateway
    - [x] Configure routing between services
    - [ ] Implement request aggregation (composition of responses)

- [ ] Set up authentication at the Gateway level
    - [x] Verify JWT tokens
    - [ ] Pass user information between services

- [ ] Implement API documentation
    - [ ] Set up Swagger/OpenAPI for shared API documentation

## Step 7: Implement Asynchronous Communication

- [ ] Choose and set up a message broker (RabbitMQ, Kafka)

- [ ] Implement event-driven interaction between services
    - [ ] Publish user creation/update events
    - [ ] Publish order creation/update events

- [ ] Handle events in respective services
    - [ ] Update local user data in the order service

## Step 8: Set Up Resilience and Reliability

- [ ] Implement resilience patterns
    - [ ] Circuit Breaker for HTTP calls between services
    - [ ] Retry with exponential backoff
    - [ ] Timeout for requests

- [ ] Set up error isolation
    - [ ] Bulkhead for resource separation
    - [ ] Handle partial failures

## Step 9: Implement Monitoring and Observability

- [x] Set up centralized logging
    - [x] Install ELK Stack or similar solution
    - [x] Add contextual logs to all services

- [ ] Set up distributed tracing
    - [ ] Install Jaeger/Zipkin/other solutions
    - [ ] Add tracing for requests across services

- [x] Set up service monitoring
    - [x] Install Prometheus/Grafana
    - [x] Set up health-check endpoints for all services

## Step 10: Deployment and DevOps

- [ ] Set up CI/CD for all services
    - [ ] Automate build and testing
    - [ ] Implement deployment strategy (blue-green, canary)

- [ ] Set up containerization
    - [ ] Optimize Docker images
    - [ ] Set up Docker Compose for local development
    - [ ] Prepare configuration for Kubernetes (optional)

- [ ] Develop a backup strategy
    - [ ] Set up database backups
    - [ ] Develop disaster recovery plans

## Future Steps and Optimizations

- [ ] Investigate further service splitting possibilities
    - [ ] Split the authorization/authentication service
    - [ ] Split the notification service

- [ ] Performance optimization
    - [ ] Implement caching
    - [ ] Optimize API Gateway

- [ ] Security
    - [ ] Conduct a security audit of microservices
    - [ ] Implement service access restrictions (Service Mesh)
